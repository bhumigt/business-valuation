One of the most useful business valuation methods under the income approach is the Multiple of Discretionary Earnings technique. Formally known as a direct capitalization valuation method, the Multiple of Discretionary Earnings lets you determine business value based on two key elements:
•	Company’s discretionary earnings
•	A set of financial and operational value factors
As with any capitalization method, the Multiple of Discretionary Earnings applies a cap rate to the business earnings to come up with a business value number. The difference is how this capitalization rate is calculated.
The approach taken by this method is to build up the cap rate based on your assessment of the business risk factors. Each factor affects your business valuation result to a different degree. Together, this business risk evaluation offers a very comprehensive yet intuitive framework for business valuation.
Here are the business valuation factors, along with a brief description of each:
Business earnings track record
Companies that generate stable, above industry average earnings, are more valuable. The higher this valuation factor, the lower the risk that business earnings can decline unexpectedly. The net effect is a greater business value.
Industry growth prospects
Firms operating in rapidly growing industry sectors are more valuable. These days companies in the health services, energy, and education are likely to face favorable growth prospects because the demand for these types of products and services is growing.
